Features for Salary Prediction

The models predict salaries based on the following parameters:

    salary_in_usd: Salary in USD

    experience_level: Level of experience (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior)

    employment_type: Type of employment (e.g., Full-time, Part-time)

    employee_residence: The geographical location of the employee

    remote_ratio: The percentage of remote work

    job_super_title: Job role title (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst)

    continent: Continent of employment

    company_size: Size of the company (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)
